Change Revenant spine to give the sightstealer buff, with two gizmo, one to turn it on, one to turn it off

The mod change the current ability to give the Dark psychic invisibility and reduce cooldown to one tick
adds an ability to remove the Dark psychic invisibility, without cooldown

Keep in mind, if you take damage, you will be temporaly visible (friendly fire, AoE, explosion, ...)


**Existing save?**
Safe to add to existing save, just reinstall the spine
Probably **not** safe to remove from existing save


This is made in XML only
